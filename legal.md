# HextechDocs Legal

*Usually the language used for legal things is Legalese, we've tried our best to keep it as easy to understand as possible*

### Using pieces of our documents or pieces of our source code

Awesome! You're more than welcome to use both. You can find the source code of this webapp on [Github](https://github.com/CommunityDragon/HexDocsClient) or if you're interested in the raw markdown files that make up our knowledgebase, [take this portal](https://github.com/CommunityDragon/HexDocs).

Keep in mind that our documents are licensed under CC-BY-SA-4.0 which means you're absolutely free to use any of our information, but you must give appropriate credit to us. This could either be on the website ([https://hexdocs.communitydragon.org](https://hexdocs.communitydragon.org)) or the link to the document on our Github repository.

As for the webapp, we've decided on GPL3 for our license which means you are free to take our source code, change it to fit your needs or improve it but you must keep the source code available and you must license it under a GPL3 compatible license.

### Contributing to our knowledgebase

Even more awesome! You can head over to our Github repositories and read the respective contribution guide on the exact process. Please keep in mind that we only have permission to use Riot's IP as per their [Legal Jibber Jabber](https://www.riotgames.com/en/legal) so if you decide to include images, make sure to ensure that you are either the rightful owner of the image (screenshots you took for example) or the copyright to the image is owned by Riot Games. We take copyright seriously. Attempting to submit an image that you cannot license to us or isn't licensed to us already, your privileges to submit new documents will be revoked.

### DMCA

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) creates a standardized process for copyright holders to inform us that we are using their copyrighted content in an unauthorized manner. If somebody has used your copyrighted content on our website and you'd like to have it taken down by us, please email *dmca-hexdocs@communitydragon.org* rather than contacting Github directly as taking down our entire content library could result in service disruptions for a public knowledgebase. In the email, you must include:

- The URL where your copyrighted content is shown
- Whether or not you're the owner of the copyrighted content or who are you in relation to the copyright owner
- Which part of the site falls under your copyright
- Whether or not we could make any changes to the document besides complete removal
- Your contact information (preferably an email) we can use to contact you
- The following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted content described herein is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law"
- The following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and I am the copyright owner or authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner of the copyright(s) allegedly infringed"
- Your full legal name as your electronic signature

We aim to reply to each of the notifications within 2 business days.

*Since none of us are legal experts, we'd like to say thank you to the awesome folks over at [Github](https://github.com) and [Buffer](https://buffer.com) as these DMCA guildelines have largely been influenced by their guildelines*
